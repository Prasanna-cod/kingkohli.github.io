    <h2> About kholi:</h2>

<p id = para1>
  Virat Kohli (born November 5, 1988, Delhi, India) is an Indian international cricketer considered by many as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the game. Kohli plays for (and previously captained) the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He is also a former captain of the Indian cricket team in all three international formats—Test cricket, one-day internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 internationals (T20I)—making him one of India’s most successful captains.

Kohli has earned praise for his discipline and commitment from teammates, opponents, and cricket veterans alike. “He has changed the face of cricket and how you prepare for the game. The discipline that he has stands out, always,” cricketing great Brian Lara said of Kohli after Kohli was named Player of the Tournament for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.

Kohli holds several cricket records, including the most individual hundreds in ODI matches and the most runs scored in a single edition of an ODI World Cup. He has been named Player of the Tournament at global events on three occasions: at the 2014 and 2016 T20I World Cups and the 2023 ODI World Cup. Kohli was also a member of the Indian sides that won the 2011 ODI World Cup, the 2013 ICC (International Cricket Council) Champions Trophy, and the 2024 T20I World Cup. He announced his retirement from Twenty20 international cricket after India won the 2024 T20I World Cup. Kohli’s announcement came after he was declared Player of the Match in the final match. He retired from Test cricket a year later, having been India’s most successful captain in the format. Kohli is married to popular Bollywood actress and producer Anushka Sharma.
